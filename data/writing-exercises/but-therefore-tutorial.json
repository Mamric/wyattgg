			"title": "Why Use But/Therefore?",
			"points": [
				"Enhances Story Flow: Moves the narrative forward logically",
				"Builds Tension and Interest: Introduces challenges and resolutions",
				"Avoids Disjointed Events: Prevents the 'and then' problem, where events feel disconnected",
				"Creates Meaningful Connections: Each story beat directly relates to what came before",
				"Improves Character Development: Shows how characters react and adapt to situations"

			"title": "Tips",
			"points": [
				"Logical Progression: Ensure each 'but' or 'therefore' logically follows from the previous statement",
				"Character Motivation: Use this method to explore your characters' decisions and motivations",
				"Conflict and Resolution Balance: A good story balances challenges with actions taken to overcome them",
				"Natural Flow: Don't force the connections - they should feel organic to the story",
				"Varying Impact: Some 'buts' and 'therefores' can be major plot points, while others drive smaller moments"
